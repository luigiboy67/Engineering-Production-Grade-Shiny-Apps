# Building a robust, production-ready web application will be made easier by following a given workflow. The one we are advocating is divided in five steps:
#   
#   Design
# Prototype
# Build
# Strengthen
# Deploy

# The first part of the workflow is the design part.

# This very first step is the one that happens before starting to code: it is the one where you are thinking about the general implementation and features of the application, and where you build the general roadmap for the coding process. During the process of designing, you will define how the application will be built: somewhere between usersâ€™ dreams, what is technically possible, and the time you have to build the application.

# The prototype part is the one during which you will build the front-end and the back-end, but separately.

# The build part is the one where you will combine the business (or back-end) logic with the front-end. In this third part, you will work on the core engine of the application, making the business logic work inside the interactive logic of your application.

# The strengthen part covers how to ensure your application is immortal, in the sense that we defined in Chapter 1 of this book.

# To deploy is to send your application into production once it is built.
